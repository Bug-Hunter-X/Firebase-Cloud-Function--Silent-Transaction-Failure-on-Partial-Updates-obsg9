# Firebase Cloud Function: Silent Transaction Failure on Partial Updates

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions where a transaction involving multiple document updates silently fails if any single update fails.  The solution implemented handles individual update failures gracefully and provides detailed error reporting.

## Problem
The `updateMultipleDocuments` function attempts to update multiple Firestore documents within a single batch.  If one of these updates encounters an error (e.g., due to a unique constraint violation), the entire batch operation fails silently.  This makes debugging complex, as there's no clear indication of which update failed and why.

## Solution
The improved solution incorporates more robust error handling by processing updates individually within the transaction. If any update fails, the function logs the error and reports the failed update to the client, instead of silently failing.  This approach makes it much easier to identify and resolve the source of errors.
